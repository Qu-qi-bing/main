  <!--This is the template page for our reviews. These comments will tell you what each tag does, what they should be replaced with, and how to make the page good. The first thing you should do is go into the top and change the file name to "reviews/(name).html". Replace name with something relevant. Make it an acronym, a short name, whatever. The reviews/ part will automatically put it in the 'Reviews' folder. Anything without a comment shouldn't really be changed.-->

Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!… Start. ding </strong>﻿</p>
